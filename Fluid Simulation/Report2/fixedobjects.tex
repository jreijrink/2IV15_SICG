\section{Fixed Objects}
The user can add fixed objects by pressing the middle mouse button. Fixed objects are maintained using a grid, that has the same size as the velocity and density grids. If a cell contains a fixed objects the value is 1, otherwise the value is 0. Each component of fixed objects consists of 5 cells. The structure is as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fixedstructure}.

This structure is convenient because the velocity for each side can be calculated separately. For example, the velocity on the top of the fixed object only uses velocity of its top neighbour. So when a fluid is directed to the top of the fixed object, it will 'bounce' in the y-axis and remain its horizontal trajectory. The mechanism is the same as the boundary conditions, and is also calculated each time boundary conditions for the outer wall are calculated. Figure \ref{fig:fixed} shows the boundary conditions of the fixed objects. The fluid is trapped inside the square of fixed objects because it bounces back on the boundaries of the fixed objects.
