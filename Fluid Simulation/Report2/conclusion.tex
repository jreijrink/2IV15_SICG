\section{Conclusion}
We implemented a stable fluid simulation which is based on stam's method \cite{stable}. Then we extended the simulation with fixed objects and moving solids and rigid bodies. Fixed objects can be created dynamically during the simulation and they adhere to the boundary conditions which were also introduces by Stam. Furthermore, we ported our particle system created in the previous project. The particles are used to create a cloth which can be influenced by the fluid and they are also used to construct moving solids and rigid bodies.\\
Lastly, we implemented a two way coupling system between the fluid and the objects. We implemented a new pressure force, which based on the velocity and density field exert pressure on a particle, so the fluid influences moving solids and rigid bodies. But moving solids and rigid bodies do also influence the velocity field based on their velocity, causing the fluid to be influenced by the objects.
