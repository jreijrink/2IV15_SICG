\section{Conclusion}

We started with the implementation of a global system to solve all forces and constraints.
With these forces and constraints we made some nice scenes such as hair and cloth, as shown in the results.
The user can also apply forces by interacting with the mouse.
Because the euler integration method is not very stable other integration methods where implemented.
Finally collision detection is implemented such as particle collisions and fixed object collisions.
