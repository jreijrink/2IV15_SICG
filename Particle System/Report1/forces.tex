\section{Forces}
The system implements two forces; \emph{gravity} and \emph{damped spring} force. The spring force is implemented according to a behaviour function $C(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$, which evaluates to zero if the desired state of the particle(s) is reached. Since gravity does not have a rest value, it not implemented using this function. Forces are implemented using an abstraction, such that the system can maintain a list of forces. Then for each time forces have to be applied, the system can easily over the force-list to apply the forces to the particles.\\
Gravity force is defined as $f_{grav} = mG$, where $m$ is the mass of a particle and $G$ is a gravitational constant. The damped spring force acts like a normal spring between two particles $p_1$ and $p_2$ with rest length $l$. The force applied by the spring on $p1$ is defined as $f_{p_1} = (k_s (|l| - r) + k_d \frac{\dot{l} \cdot l}{|l|}) * \frac{l}{|l|}$, where $l = x_{p_1} - x_{p_2}$ and $\dot{l} = v_{p_1} - v_{p_2}$, $k_s$ is the stiffness of the spring and $k_d$ is a damping constant.
